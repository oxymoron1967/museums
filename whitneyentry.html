        <h2>Why visit The Whitney?</h2>

        <p>The Whitney focuses on contemporary American art and its permanent collection is impressive. The building itself is beautiful and the views from its windows are amazing.</p>
    
    <h2>Some favorite exhibits</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://whitney.org/Exhibitions/GrantWood">Grant Wood at the Whitney</a>
        
        <p>We all know Grant Wood for <i>American Gothic</i>, but there is so much more to his work. He did portraiture and landscapes, frequently with a sense of humor.</p></li>
        
        <li><a href="https://whitney.org/Exhibitions/AndyWarhol">Andy Warholâ€” From A to B and Back Again</a>
        
        <p>This was aretrospective of Warhol's career. It was interesting to see how Warhol's work developed over time its influence.</p></li>

        <li><a href="https://whitney.org/Exhibitions/AnIncompleteHistoryOfProtest">An Incomplete History of Protest</a>
        
        <p>This exhibit was mostly posters, but there were some multimedia, it started with Civil Rights and anti-Vietnam protests, then continued to AIDS protest up until the present day. The posters were eye catching and frequently upsetting. This was one of those exhibit that I left in a somber mood. </p></li>

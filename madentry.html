    <h2>Why visit the Museum of Art and Design?</h2>

    <p>The Museum of Art and Design focuses on the decorative arts and crafts and other forms of design. Their permanent jewelry collection is something to see. One of the things I love about MAD is that it always goes all out. Its exhibits are always worth seeing, even when they don't quote work.</p>

<h2>Some favorite exhibits</h2>

<ul><h3>
    <li><a href="https://madmuseum.org/exhibition/too-fast-live-too-young-die">Too Fast to Live, Too Young to Die
        PUNK GRAPHICS, 1976â€“1986</a>

    <p>This exhibit celebrates the art and design of the Punk and New Wave movements. This was a great exhibit for me because I recognized a lot of the album covers, though not the posters. I walked through it thinking, "I know that band, and that one, and that one... I know that band name, but fon't rememeber any of their songs." It wasn't just album covers snd posters, either. They had fanzines and pins, and some concert footage.</p></li>  

    <li><a href="https://madmuseum.org/sonic-arcade-shaping-space-with-sound">Sonic Arcade: Shaping Space with Sound</a>
    
    <p>This exhibit included a gallery where the artist/musician built out a wall then tuned it, and strung it,so you could play it. I was the only person there when I went to see it, and spent a good twenty monutes pkaying the wall. It was so much fun. </p></li>

    <h2>Why Visit The American Folk Art Museum?</h2>


    <p>The Folk Art Museum focuses on art made by people who aren't formally trained as artists and arts and crafts not considered "high art", like foil painting and quilting. Many of the exhibits focus on people from marginalized communities who had to use non-traditional materials like cardboard or the lid of a coffee can.</p>

<h2>Some favorite exhibits</h2>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://folkartmuseum.org/exhibitions/made-in-new-york-city/">Made in New York City: The Business of Folk Art</a>
    
    <p>This exhibit focused on the art used to promote businesses, so things like signs, ads, wooden sculptures, etc. I loved this because, sine most of the itmes were from the 19th century, it gave a view into the day to day life of NYC at the time in a way I've never seen.

    <li><a href="https://folkartmuseum.org/exhibitions/war-and-pieced-the-annette-gero-collection-of-quilts-from-military-fabrics/">War and Pieced: The Annette Gero Collection of Quilts from Military Fabrics</a>
    
    <p>One of the Folk Art MUseum's focuses is quilts. They have done man exhibits on quilts over the years. This is perhaps the most interesting because it was all quilts made by military personnel recovering from injuries. They used scraps of unforms and other military material to make the quilts. The level of detail involved in these quilts amazed me. They were all stunning.</p></li>

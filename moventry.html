    <h2>Why visit The Museum of the Moving Image?</h2>

    <p>MoMI is all about media. Its permanent exhibits are all interesting and fun. You can make your own stop action animation movie, for example. It also has a huge collection of action difures and other collectibles that wouldn't be in collections in other museums. The permanent Jim Henson exhibit is wonderful, and alone is worth the proce of admission. One of my favorite things is a short silent film called <b>The Great Train Robbery</b>. Part way through it. they had a hoedown, for no good reason. Seriously, it was all "We have to hunt down the bad guys, but first, LET'S DANCE!". This is a great place for families because it has lots of interactive exhibits.</p>

    <li><a href="http://www.movingimage.us/exhibitions/2014/07/19/detail/whats-up-doc-the-animation-art-of-chuck-jones/">Whatâ€™s Up, Doc? The Animation Art of Chuck Jones at MoMI</a></li>

    <p>Chuck Jones was the creative mind behind many of the most iconic American cartoons, from <b>The Grinch who Stole Christmas</b> to <b>What's Opera Doc?</b>. In fact, <b>What's Opera, Doc?</b> had it's own section in the exhibit. Every wekeend during the exhibition, MoMI screened famous Chuck Jones cartoons. I's seen these cartoons gazillions of times, but seeing them on the big screen was special.</p>

    <li><a href="http://www.movingimage.us/exhibitions/2017/07/22/detail/the-jim-henson-exhibition/">The Jim Henson Exhibition</a>
    
    <p>This exhibit is all about Henson's career, from its very beginning, though <b>Sesame Street, The Muppet Show, Fraggle Rock, and Dark Crystal</b>. It's a great exhibit. Along with that, Tut's Dream, a small theater screens Muppet Show episodes daily.</p></li>



    <li><a href="http://www.movingimage.us/exhibitions/2017/05/13/detail/video-arcade/">Video Arcade</a>
    
    <p>MoMI has collected video games, and always has a few out on display (that you can play!). Well, a few years ago, they took their exhibition space on the 3rd floor and converted it into an arcade, with over twenty games that you can play. It was so much fun.</p></li>

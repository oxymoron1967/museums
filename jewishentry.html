        <h2>Why Visit The Jewish Museum?</h2>

        <p>The Jewish Museum's permanent collection is amazing. One of the things I learned from it is that there really isn't a standard menorah, so there are lots of varieties. The collection has things from antiquity and the JEwish diaspora to today.</p>

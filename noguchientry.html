        <h2>Why  visit The Noguchi?</h2>

        <p>Izumo Noguchi was a Japanese-American sculptor. He used stone in manyof his peices, and they have an abstract feel to them. The space is also interesting. It's his former studio in Astoria. It also has a rock garden, which is a beautiful space. </p>
    
    <h2>Some favorite exhibits</h2>
    
    <ul><h3>
        <li><a href="https://www.noguchi.org/artworks/collection/">The Main Collection</a>
        
        <p>The main collection houses many of his scultpures, large and small, and the paper lanterns he made. The museum doesn't label the pieces but each gallery has laminated cards that describe the displays. I kind of prefer to make up my own narratives, though.</p></li>

        <h2>Why visit the Smithsonian?</h2>

        <p>The Smithsonian has many campuses and affiliates across the country, but for this, I am focuins on the ones in Washington, DC. They are all worth visiting becuase they are so siddferent and so many exhibits. I could (and may someday) go to DC for a week and visit a different Smithsonian every week.</p>
    
    <h2>Some favorite exhibits</h2>
    
    <ul><h3>
        <li><a href="https://www.si.edu/exhibitions/americas-presidents:event-exhib-6150">America's Presidents at the National Portrait Gallery</a>
        
        <p>These are the official portraits of the American presdients. Most of them are what you'd expect, but some stand out. Andrew JAckson looks like a villain from a Dickens novel, for example, and whoever told Chester Alan Arthur that that was a good look lied to him.</p></li>
        
        <li><a href="https://www.si.edu/exhibitions/greensboro-lunch-counter:event-exhib-6265">The Greensboro Lunch Counter at the National Museum of American History</a>
        
        <p>The National Museum of American History has many important permanent exhibits. I chose this one because of its important role in ending segregation during the Civil Rights movement.</p></li>

        <li><a href="https://www.si.edu/exhibitions/first-ladies:event-exhib-4722">The First Ladies at the National Museum of American History</a>
        
        <p>This exhibit of the First Ladies' dresses is perhaps the best-known exhibit in the National Museum of American History. I've visited it twice. The presidential china, which is also on display there, wasn;t up when I went thorugh the exhibit because they were installing a new exhibit in the galleries next to it. Maybe I'll try again the next time I'm there.</p></li>

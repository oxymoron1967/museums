    <h2>Why the Cooper-Hewitt is great</h2>

    <p>The Cooper-Hewitt is the official Smithsonian Museum of Design. It's housed in the old Carnegie family mansion in New York City. Because its focus is design, its exhibiions are different than those you would see at an art or history museum. So, alot of what they do is unexpected. They once did an exhibition on the design of dinnerware, for exmaple. The Cooper=Hewitt also has these workstations scattered throughout the building, where you can make you own designs and then email the results to yourself. Those are fun for everyone. Their triennial design exhbitions are not to be missed. You can easily spend an afternnon here.</p>

        <p>This is why I love this place. I don't think any of the other museums I belong to would do an exhibition like this -- well, the Museum of Art and Design might. This exhibit was about designing things to makelife easier for those with disabilities. I was fascinated by the work the designers did and the creativity they showed.</p></li>

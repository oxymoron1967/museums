        <h2>Why Visit The Frick Pittsburgh?</h2>

        <p>The Frick Pittsburgh isn't just one building, it's a campus, including Clayton, the family's mansion, the greenhouse, the garage, the museum, and other buildings. You could easily spend all day here. For example, the mansion shows how the rich of the Gilded Age lived and the museum houses the collection of Henry Clay Frick's daughter, Helen.</p>


    <h2>Some favorite exhibits</h2>
    
    <ul><h3>
        <li><a href="https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/Exhibition-Katharine-Hepburn-Dressed-for-Stage-and-Screen/">Katharine Hepburn: Dressed for Stage and Screen</a>
        <p>Hepburn would often keep the costumes made for her or would hire the designer to make a copy of it for her. This collection, which is housed at Kent State University, showed the range of costumes she wore and, therefore the range of her axting career. The designers were also discussed. </p></li>
        
        <li><a href="https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/Exhibition-Permanent-Collection">The Permanent Collection</a>
        <p>The Museum is where Helen Clay Frick's collection is housed. It includes galleries of European Art and galleries of Asian porcelain.</p></li>

        <li><a href="https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/Clayton">Clayton: the Frick family mansion in Pittsburgh</a>
        <p>You need to have reservations to enter, and it's a guided tour, but it worth visiting. You go from room to room with a docent who points out the highlights of the room. One of my favorites was the hone room because, at the time the Fricks lived in Clayton, Pittsburgh had six or seven phones. </p></li>

    <h2>Why Visit The Frick?</h2>

    <p>The Frick family mansion in NYC is filled with art. In many ways, it's a greatest hits of Western Art. If you've ever taken an art history class, you will recognize many of the paintings. The furnishings are the same as when the family lived there. I especially love the indoor garden. It's just a great place to sit and relax.</p>

<h2>Some favorite exhibits</h2>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.frick.org/exhibitions/scher">The Pursuit of Immortality: Masterpieces from the Scher Collection of Portrait Medals</a>
    
    <p>This was an interesting exhibit. I would habve never thought of portraiture on coins and medals something worth exhibitng, but it was. Medals celebrated people and also dosplayed power. There is a lot of symbolism here.</p></li>

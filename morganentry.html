    <h2>Why visit The Morgan</h2>

<p>The Morgan is worth visiting just for the library. It is amazing. The Morgan has three Gutenberg Bibles, so one is always on display. J.P. Morgan's oddicec is also worth visiting. The Rotunda is beautiful, and has benches. It's a great place to sit down and people watch. The Morgan also has spaces for temporary exhibitions, and they focus on works on paper. They have done exhibits on musicians, autographs, books, and drawings.</p>

<h2>Some favorite exhibits</h2>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.themorgan.org/exhibitions/wayne-thiebaud">Wayne Thiebaud, Draftsman</a>
    
    <p>Thiebaud is an American artist who is best known for painting things like items found in a diner. He also did some cityscapes. He attention to detail is stunning. I never heard of Thiebaud before this exhibition, and I loved the works on display here.</p></li>



    <li><a href="https://www.themorgan.org/exhibitions/tolkien">Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth</a>
    
    <p>This was not really about the books, it was more about his artwork for the books. His first detailed map of Middle Earth was there, for example. The most fun thing about this exhuibit though, was the crowd, who came in costume. In fact, the Morgan out up a sign telling the folks dressed up as Gandalf to check their staves.</p></li>

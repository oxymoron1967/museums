<h2>Why visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</h2>

<p>The Met is a massive place. It is perhaps the greatest art museum in the United States. Just about every genre of art is represented there. You won't be able to get thrpough it all in one day. I suggest that you go to the website, lookat the map and figure out two or three sections to go through.</p>

<h2>Some favorite exhibits</h2>

<ul>
<h3>
        <li><a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/michelangelo">Michelangelo: Divine Draftsman and Designer</a>
        
        <p>This blockbuster exhibtion focused on Michelangelo's drawings, but the highlight for me was the gallery where they broadcasted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel on the ceiling and had six kiosks. Each kiosk had Michelangelo's practice drawing for the section it highlighted. It was magnificent.</p></li>

        <li><a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/apollos-muse-moon-photography">Apollo's Muse: The Moon in the Age of Photogtaphy</a>
        
        <p>This exhibit was on the 50th anniverary of the Moon Landing. It was amazing. It included fampus photos of the moon, and audio of the moon landing. </p></li>

        <li><a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/jerusalem">Jerusalem 1000-1400 Every People under Heaven</a>
        
        <p>Jerusalem was at the center of many trade routes, so it was a multicultural area. This exhibit was about how all those cultures mixed.</p></li>

        <li><a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/relative-values-northern-renaissance">Relative Values: Cost of Art in the Northern Renaissance at the Met</a>
        
        <p>This exhibit discussed how much various things cost, but in terms of cows. So, a pewter mug might be 1/4 of a cow, while a crystal goble would be 110 cows. This was a fun way to define how much things cost at the time.</p></li>
